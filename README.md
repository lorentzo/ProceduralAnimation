# About

Procedural animation course.

Inspiration and types:
* Abstract vs regular.
* Nature vs human-made.
* Organic vs hard-surface.

Applications:
* Game worlds (environments, foliage, natural phenomena)
* Animation worlds
* VFX
* Motion graphics
* Generative Art
* Botany and plants
* Visualization
* Arhitecture
* Algorithmic design

The aim:
* Structure of procedural animation
* Theoretical background of procedural animation
* Practical tools and methods for procedural animation
* Conceptual understanding of methods and tools (not low-level implementation)
* Learning by doing
* Presenting using stylized rendering and compositing

# Course 

Procedural animation methods:
* Physically-based approaches
  * classical mechanics, forces and constraints
  * fluids: gases and liquids
  * solids: rigid bodies and soft bodies
* Biological simulation
  * Growth
  * Branching (recursion)
  * Reaction, Reaction-diffusion
  * Phenomenological simulation
* Mathematics:
  * Iterative systems and chaos
  * Cells and automation
* Empirical CG
  * Procedural noise, layering and warping
  * L-Systems
  * Boids 
  * Geometric instancing (including arraying)
  * Particles and force fields

CG methods:
* 3D scene: lights, cameras, materials and shapes (meshes, voxles, curves, etc.)
* Rendering: GPU raster, CPU path-tracing
* Post-processing

Software:
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/)
